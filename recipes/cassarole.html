        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>  green bean casserole is one of the Thanksgiving Tredional dish. </p>
        <p>The recipe was created in 1955 by Dorcas Reilly </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul><li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 large yellow onions, thinly sliced lengthwise</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sherry vinegar</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol><li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir the onions into the pan; cook and stir until very soft and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Stir in sherry vinegar. Transfer to a small bowl, and reserve.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, melt 2 more tablespoons butter. Whisk in 2 tablespoons flour. Stirring constantly, cook over medium heat until the flour smells like baked pie crust, about 3 minutes. Slowly whisk in milk, about 1/2 cup at a time, then whisk in nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and thyme. Bring to simmer, and cook until thickened, whisking constantly, 3 more minutes. Transfer to a bowl and reserve.</li> 
            <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in clean skillet; stir in panko until all crumbs are coated; reserve.</li>  
            <li>Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil over medium heat, and boil beans until bright green and crisp but not raw tasting, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain very well.</li>
            <li>Spoon half of the caramelized onions into the prepared casserole dish; top with green beans. Season with salt and black pepper. Spread reserved white sauce over the green beans; sprinkle with half of the Gruyere cheese. Top with the rest of the onions, and use the back of a spoon to push onions down into sauce and cheese. Top with the buttered panko crumbs, the remaining Gruyere, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until hot throughout and lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Let sit 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
